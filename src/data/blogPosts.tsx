        <p className="mb-4">
          In the age of digital acceleration, data is currency. But too often, businesses are sitting on mountains of data that offer very little insight. Why? Because their analytics ecosystem is fragmented, inconsistent, or just plain broken.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">What Does a Broken Analytics Ecosystem Look Like?</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
          <li>Metrics mean different things in different departments.</li>
          <li>Reports take days to produce and still raise more questions than answers.</li>
          <li>Data pipelines fail silently or deliver outdated information.</li>
          <li>Dashboards are cluttered, underused, or simply wrong.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          These are symptoms of a deeper problem: lack of data trust. When people don't trust the numbers, they don't act on them. And when that happens, the entire analytics operation loses credibility.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">The Cost of Not Knowing</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          When data doesn't flow correctly, decisions suffer. Teams waste time reconciling reports. Opportunities get missed. And leadership can't move with clarity. According to Gartner, poor data quality costs organizations an average of $12.9 million per year.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Analytics teams are often stuck firefighting, patching pipelines, fixing reports, justifying numbers, instead of delivering insights. This leads to fatigue, inefficiency, and strategic misalignment.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">What an Analytics Audit Uncovers</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          A structured audit evaluates your entire data workflow. It identifies:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
          <li>Inconsistent definitions and ties across teams</li>
          <li>Pipeline bottlenecks and system inefficiencies</li>
          <li>Underutilized tools or siloed platforms</li>
          <li>Skill gaps and ownership ambiguities</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          You may discover that your metrics don't align with business goals, or that your "real-time" dashboard is operating on a 24-hour delay. An audit makes the invisible visible.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">A Quick Self-Assessment Checklist</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Ask yourself and your team:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
          <li>Do we trust the reports we use?</li>
          <li>Are metrics consistent across departments?</li>
          <li>Is our data timely and relevant?</li>
          <li>Can our decision-makers access data independently?</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          If you answered "no" to any of the above, your analytics ecosystem needs a tune-up.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Let's Fix the Foundation</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Your analytics strategy is only as strong as the foundation it's built on. An analytics audit is the fastest way to see what's working, what's broken, and what needs to evolve. It's not about blame, it's about progress.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          With a clear roadmap, your team can refocus on what really matters: driving business outcomes through smart, data-driven decisions.
